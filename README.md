Urgent! Aliens are attacking Earth’s Base!!
Your task is to give reinforcement and protect the Earth's shelter from the enemy spaceships.

You got the News and you head to your spaceship. After the control tower counts to 3.. 2.. 1.., your spaceship ignites and you enter outer space. As you travel     towards the space, you notice that there are alien spaceships coming to attack Earth. The aliens have advanced spaceships which shoot and move on it’s own.

Enemy Wave: (Enemy shooting single bullet)
Aliens have noticed you and they sent many spaceships to kill you. Each spaceship has different patterns to destroy you! Enemy spaceship is equipped with a         single laser gun. You engage in an intense fight. As you shoot down the enemies you gain Score (Coins). You can use these Score (Coins) to upgrade your             spaceship and the bullets.

You’ve got 2 chances to destroy as many enemy spaceships as you can. After that your health would be half the health it was before. Once your spaceship gets         destroyed 5 times, the Game is Over!
